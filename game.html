            A bit about our past
            The first GAME store opened in Durban, South Africa, in 1970. It was born
            out of the belief by its founders that shopping had become a tedious
            and boring pastime. They wanted to create a fun shopping environment
            and so conceptualized retailing as a game. The signature shocking pink has still prevailed to this day.
            We operate out of 150 stores in 12 African countries.</p6>
